OBJECTIVES:
The primary objective of the food delivery website is to provide customers with a convenient and user-friendly platform to order food online. The website will offer a broad range of local restaurants, cuisines, and delivery options to customers. The website will also enable restaurant owners to expand their reach and connect with a broader customer base.

SCOPE:
The food delivery website will be designed to cater to the needs of customers and restaurant owners. Customers will be able to search for nearby restaurants, view menus, and place orders online. Restaurant owners will have the ability to manage orders, update menus, and track deliveries.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
The website will have two types of users: customers and restaurant owners. Customers will be able to browse through the menus of different restaurants and add their preferred dishes to their shopping cart. They will also be able to filter their search results based on various criteria such as cuisine type, price range, and proximity. Once the order is confirmed, customers can track the status of their order, from preparation to delivery. They will also have the option to pay for their orders online or in person upon delivery.

Restaurant owners will be able to create their profile on the website and upload their menus, pricing, and images. They will be able to manage their orders, view customer reviews, and respond to feedback. They will also have access to analytics such as sales reports, order history, and customer data.

The website will be built using modern web development technologies and will be optimized for mobile and desktop devices. The website will also have a user-friendly interface and a responsive design that provides an intuitive and seamless user experience. The website will also have features for user authentication, data security, and privacy protection.

Overall, the food delivery website project aims to provide a convenient and hassle-free way for customers to order food from their favorite restaurants, while also providing restaurant owners with an efficient way to manage their online presence and attract more customers.
